# Frontend Performance Optimization - MockMate AI

## Overview
Implementing comprehensive performance optimizations including code splitting, error boundaries, lazy loading, and bundle optimization for the MockMate AI interview platform.

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Error Boundaries & Error Handling
- [x] Create reusable ErrorBoundary component
- [ ] Add error boundary to main layout
- [ ] Wrap route components with error boundaries
- [ ] Test error scenarios and fallback UI

### Phase 2: Code Splitting & Dynamic Imports
- [ ] Convert LandingPage to dynamic import in main page
- [ ] Convert Dashboard to dynamic import in main page
- [ ] Add lazy loading for heavy components (SessionHistory, Analytics)
- [ ] Implement Suspense boundaries with loading fallbacks

### Phase 3: Skeleton Loading Components
- [ ] Create LandingPage skeleton component
- [ ] Create Dashboard skeleton component
- [ ] Create InterviewRoom skeleton component
- [ ] Replace basic loading spinners with skeleton screens

### Phase 4: Next.js Configuration Optimization
- [ ] Update next.config.js with performance optimizations
- [ ] Add bundle analyzer configuration
- [ ] Enable compression and optimization features
- [ ] Configure image optimization settings

### Phase 5: Bundle Size Optimization
- [ ] Implement tree shaking optimizations
- [ ] Optimize component-level imports
- [ ] Add performance monitoring
- [ ] Test and verify bundle size improvements

### Phase 6: Testing & Verification
- [ ] Test all loading states and error boundaries
- [ ] Verify code splitting is working correctly
- [ ] Check bundle size improvements
- [ ] Test user experience with new loading states
